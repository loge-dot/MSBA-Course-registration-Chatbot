- **Course Description**: Business decision making involves considerable complexity and uncertainty. To assist decision making, managers need to tease out useful information from data. In particular, managers should be able to use data to evaluate the impact of their decisions and to make predictions for their decisions. To make decisions in a scientific way, managers need to be able to build mathematical models for their decisions and solve their problems with the help of computer software. This course introduces a wide array of quantitative analysis methods to help students gain a clear understanding of the decision-making process in business and management. These methods provide students with the tools and skills to approach, analyze, and solve problems of varying scales. Furthermore, this course aims at improving a decision-maker’s overall problem-solving ability by stressing approaches to 1) understand and question assumptions, 2) consider a richer set of solution alternatives, and 3) consider diverse measures of performance. The teaching methods will include lectures, discussions, and demonstration of several software packages.

**Course Description:**  
This course introduces the concepts of operations management and the application of analytic techniques in solving problems an organization faces in its operations. An organization's ultimate success depends on how efficiently and effectively it executes its strategic goals. This requires its operational goals to be aligned with its strategic goals. A detailed understanding of the processes used to produce and deliver goods and/or provide services to customers is essential. Operations Management is a field which focuses on these aspects of an organization. Operations of an organization concerns the management of the processes which convert inputs into outputs. Effective operations management involves managing people, equipment, and other resources. In the typical business organization, the majority of the costs and controllable assets are managed by the operations function. Thus, this discipline–with the techniques, procedures, and knowledge it encompasses–is a vital segment of business activity. This course will provide students with the analytical tools needed to understand and articulate the impact of an organization's processes and the ability to continuously improve these processes.

Storytelling with data is essential in business because it transforms complex data into understandable, impactful narratives that drive decision-making. Data alone can be overwhelming or meaningless to stakeholders who may not be experts in analytics. By using storytelling techniques, businesses can contextualize insights, connect with audiences on an emotional level, and convey the relevance of data in a way that motivates action. Well-crafted data stories help simplify trends, highlight key metrics, and reveal patterns, making information more accessible and actionable for teams, executives, and clients alike.
